 *   Life cycle: (It's very important to know when we bind the event)
 *  	A widget will do this by order :
 *  		1. $init
 *   		2. set attributes (setters)
 *   		3. rendering mold (@see mold/texttab.js )
 *   		4. call bind_ to bind the event to dom .
 *
 *  	this.deskop will be assigned after super bind_ is called,
 *      so we use it to determine whether we need to update view
 *		manually in setter or not.
 *		If this.desktop exist , means it's after mold rendering.
